# ARDENT
The Algorithm for the Refinement of DEtection limits via N-body stability Threshold (ARDENT) is a python package for the computation of detection limits from radial velocity data. In addition to the classic data-driven detection limits, ARDENT includes the orbital stability constraint (what we call dynamical detection limits). The final output is a more constraining detection limits curve, taking into account both the detectability of potential planets and their dynamical plausibility. 

The code can be used as two separate modules, for the data-driven detection limits and the dynamical detection limits. ARDENT can be used to refine the detection limits, test the dynamical plausibility of a planet candidate, and check if there is dynamical room for additional planets in a certain period range. 

### Installation 
The simplest way to install ardent on your machine is to use pip. Given that some dependencies have specific versions, I recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with your own system. 

### Use 
Follow the steps of the ardent/WorkingExample.py file.
